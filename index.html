            <p id="post1">I recently bought a new house. The rise of rent this year made it no longer
                sensible to rent. But with a puchase like this you take a lot more risk. We 
                were unlucky with our purchase. The house was in good condition but the previous owner 
                concealed a crack in the foundation causing a leak in the finished basement.
                It wasn't noticeable for even the inspector as the only way to tell was to lay on
                the carpet and feel that it was wet. So this weekend I tore up the carpet, the wall, and the 
                subfloor. I then cleaned the foundation and put in a new waterproof subfloor. This took roughly
                about 14 hours worth of work. The question is what could we have done to learn of this before buying
                the house or was it just unavoidable.

            <p id="post2">
                I've been coding in java lately for an android development class. We've 
                been working on a multiplayer chess game as a team project. What I've been 
                surprised by is how much easier it is to code with then any of the lower level
                classes. The IDE basically auto completes' all of the code. So the experience 
                with java is minimal. It makes me wonder how important it is to learn old style 
                languages today. If the majority of the code base has been automated then wouldn't 
                it be better to be learning a language that is newer and still developing. I can't 
                imagine a better way to teach computer science students. As students we are constantly
                looking for ways to improve our knowledge and skill. A fresh language gives a lot of 
                room to grow into our skillset.
